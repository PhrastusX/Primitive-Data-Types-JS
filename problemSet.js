// Write your first name as a string and your last name as a string
"Theo"
"Diehl"

// Now, print your first name and last name separately using Javascript’s console.log method. More information can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log. Try this with single quotes and double quotes.

console.log("Theo")
console.log("Diehl")

// Now, print your first and last name out in the same line of code using concatenation

console.log("Theo" + " Diehl")

// In written form, explain what a string is and what every string requires
/* A sting is a data type in JS.  Every string requires either "" or '' or `` around it */

// Integer and Float Practice


// In written form, explain what an integer is and what a float is. How do they differ?
/* An int is a data type that does not have a decimal point. A float is a data type that has a decimal point. */


// Using the Javascript console, practice mathematical operations including

// – Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

console.log( 1 +1 , 2-3, 2 *3, 4/2 )

// – Modulus

console.log( 5 % 2) //output will be 1 gives back the remainder.

// – Incrementing and Decrementing 
let i = 0
i += 1
console.log(i) //should be 1

let x = 1
x -= 1
console.log(x) // should be 0

// – Exponents

let e = 2 **2
console.log(e) // should be 4

// Next, practice solving mathematical problems using the order of operations

const pi = 3.14


let area = pi*1**2

console.log(area)//prints out area of a circle
